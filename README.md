Miscellanous SharePoint 2010 Helper code
I wrote this a few years ago as a way to capture some repetive tasks. 
The code was designed so that theoretically, I could drop a reference in a SharePoint solution and upgrade or even specify new pieces for individual site collections and webs. In practice I just updated the entire codebase. Use the code at your own risk. 
I've personally used the code in production environments for what it's worth.
